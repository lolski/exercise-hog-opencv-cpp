Trying OpenCV's implementation of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), as presented by Dallal & Triggs in https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf

The most important functions being implemented are computeHog which computes HOG value of an image, and visualizeHog which overlays the HOG value in a visual manner on top of the real image.
